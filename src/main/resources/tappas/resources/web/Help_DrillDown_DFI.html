<p>The DFI gene feature ID data visualization displays a line chart with the expression levels for the selected gene and feature ID based on the original row where the drill down was requested. 
    The chart displays the two conditions on the x-axis and the corresponding expression levels on the y-axis.
    Two lines are displayed in the chart:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With Feature ID - sum of expression levels, for each condition, for all gene transcripts containing the feature ID</li>
        <li>Without Feature ID - sum of expression levels, for each condition, for all gene transcripts NOT containing the feature ID</li>
    </ul>
The DS status for the gene feature ID and condition favored, for 'with feature ID', information are also displayed on the chart.
Note that the mouseover feature for line charts only works on the endpoints of the line.<br/>
