    <p>The DPA Summary subtab contains multiple plots and charts summarizing the analysis results. These may vary depending on the significance threshold chosen.
	If you wish to recalculate the summary, close the subtab, change the significance level using the left hand-side bar menu, and open it again.</p>
    <div style="padding-left:25px;">
        <p><b>% Genes DPA Results</b> pie chart showing the proportion of DPA genes vs the proportion of not DPA genes.</p>
        <p><b>% Distal DPA Results</b> pie chart showing the percentage of genes that are predominantly distal-expressing on each of the conditions (i.e. the Distal Condition column),
		as well as the percentage that undergo polyA site switching in each case.</p>
        <p><b>DPA Summary Table </b> - shows the number of coding and non-coding genes that are detected as DPA, and the total numbers in each category.</p>
        <p><b>Genes Log2 Fold Change Distribution</b> bar chart - histogram of Log2FC values (binned) for distal and proximal site expression for all analyzed genes.</p>
        <p><b>DPA heatmap</b> - for each significantly DPA gene, the polyA site usage proportion in each analyzed condition is shown. The heatmap is divided between polyA switching
		and not switching genes. Allows an intuitive visualization of the polyA site usage differences, as well as the most distal-expressing condition.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following requirements apply to this analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For a gene to be included in this analysis, it must have multiple isoforms and contain at least two different polyA sites. For genes with more than two sites, 
		a polyA site definition algorithm is applied (see web documentation).</li>
    </ul>
