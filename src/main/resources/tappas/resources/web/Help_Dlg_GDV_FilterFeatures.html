    <div><span class="contentTitle">Annotation Features Displayed Filter</span></div>
    <p>The annotation features filter allows you to remove unwanted features from the display so that you can see the ones that you are interested in.
        A typical case is the display of miRNAs. If you are only interested in one or more specific miRNAs, it may be hard to see them when you have a large number of them being displayed.
        To select which annotation features to display, the following controls are provided:
    </p>
    <div style="padding-top:7px; padding-left:20px; font-weight: normal; color:black;"><b>Annotation Feature(s) - </b>select the annotation feature(s) to include in the display.
        Note that the tree contains one branch per annotation source and each branch can be expanded to show all the features it contains.
        In addition, each feature sub branch may be expanded to show all the feature IDs it contains.
        You may select all features for a given annotation source or expand and select specific features only.
        Additionally, you may select all feature IDs for a given feature or expand and select specific feature IDs only.
    </div>
    <div style="padding-top:7px; padding-left:20px; font-weight: normal; color:black;"><b>Clear All - </b>click to clear all selected features
    </div>
    <div style="padding-top:7px; padding-left:20px; font-weight: normal; color:black;"><b>Check All - </b>click to check, select, all features
