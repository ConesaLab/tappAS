    <p>The FEA Results data table displays the statistical results for the functional enrichment analysis,
        which can simultaneously include functional features from all categories selected for analysis. To view results for specific subsets
        of features, use the filtering menu on the left hand-side bar.
        The following table columns are displayed by default:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Source - annotation source from which the feature was obtained.</li>
        <li>Feature - feature name as specified in the annotation file. Note that, for GO terms, Ontology classifications
        are shown (P = Process, F = Function, C = Component).</li>
        <li>Feature ID - feature ID as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Description - feature ID description providing more details on functionality/annotation type, 
        if available, as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Significant - enrichment result given by user-defined threshold (on adjusted p-value): YES or NO. To change the significance threshold
        applied to consider a feature as significant, use the thresholding option on the left hand-side menu.</li>
        <li>Over P-Value - p-value for over representation test</li>
        <li>Under P-Value - p-value for under representation test</li>
        <li>Adjusted P-Value - over representation test FDR adjusted p-value.</li>
        <li>Test with ID - number of items - genes, CDS, or transcripts - in test group containing the Feature ID.</li>
        <li>Total with ID - total number of items - genes, CDS, or transcripts - in the comparing list (i.e. background list) 
        containing the Feature ID.</li>
    </ul>
    Right-click any feature to access the "Drill down" menu and see the list of feature names/IDs -genes, CDS or transcripts- in the test list
    containing that feature.
