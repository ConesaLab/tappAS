    <p>The FEA Clusters data table displays the GO term cluster analysis results. 
        Two tables are displayed: a list of GO term Clusters on the left, and a Cluster Nodes sub-table containing information on the 
        GOterm members of each cluster node, on the right.
        When a cluster on the Clusters table (left) is highlighted, i.e. by clicking on the corresponding row, the nodes (GO terms) 
        contained in that cluster are displayed on the Cluster Nodes table. <span class="standout">Note that you may hold the Shift-key down to select 
        and view GO terms included in multiple clusters</span>.</p>
    <p>The Clusters table, situated left side of the upper panel, contains the following columns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cluster ID - cluster number, starting at 1.</li>
        <li>Name - name given to cluster when displayed on the clusters graph. 
        Note: to visualize the clusters graph, click the visualization button on the left hand-side panel, beside the table.</li>
        <li>Nodes - number of nodes (GO terms) that form the cluster.</li>
        <li>% - percentage of total nodes (GO terms) contained in the cluster.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Cluster Nodes table, situated on the right side of the upper panel, contains the following columns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cluster ID - sequential cluster number, starting at 1.</li>
        <li>Node (Feature ID) - node: GO term ID as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Name - GO term ID description, if available, retrieved from the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Feature - biological aspect described by that GO term, i.e. C = Component, P = Process or F = Function.</li>
        <li>Adjusted P-Value - FDR adjusted p-value obtained in the Functional Enrichment Analysis for that GO term.</li>
        <li>Test Items - genes in Test group annotated for that GO term (note that GO terms only exist as a gene-level annotation).</li>
        <li>Total Items - total number of genes annotated for that GO term, including test and background lists.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- HiddenColumns -->
    <ul>
        <li>Non-Test Items - number of genes NOT in Test group that are annotated for that GO term.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="notes" style="padding-left:25px; padding-bottom:10px;">Row selection (<input type="checkbox" style="vertical-align:middle; font-size:x-small;" disabled>) is not supported for these tables but sequential row id (#) columns are displayed</span><br/>
