    <div><span class="contentTitle">Project Data Visualization: Proteins DEA Summary</span></div>
    <p>The Proteins DEA Summary subtab contains multiple visual display controls, along with a supporting table, summarizing the proteins DEA results.
    The display controls are described below by position, left to right.</p>
    <div style="padding-left:25px;">
        <p><b>Proteins DEA Results</b> pie chart and data table - the pie chart displays the proportions for differentially and not differentially expressed proteins.
            The table displays the following table columns for single transcript, multiple transcript, and total proteins:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protein - protein type</li>
            <li>DE - number of differentially expressed proteins of given type</li>
            <li>Not DE - number of NOT differentially expressed proteins of given type</li>
            <li>Total - total number of proteins of given type</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Proteins Log2 Fold Change Distribution</b> bar chart - displays the L2FC distribution for all proteins.
            The bins for the fold changes are shown on the x-axis with the down-regulated proteins on the left part and the up-regulated proteins on the right. 
            Square brackets, [], are used to denote values that are inclusive and parentheses, (), for values that are exclusive. 
            For example, a bin with a "[5, 10)" label contains values from 5 to less than 10, i.e. inclusive of 5 but exclusive of 10.
            Note that up and down regulation is based on the condition comparison you selected for the analysis.
            The total number of proteins for a given bin is determined by the height of the bars along the y-axis.
            Negative values are used for down regulated counts, on the y-axis, for visualization purposes only; counts are always positive.
        </p>

    <span class="notes" style="padding-left:25px;">The expression level for a protein is the sum of the normalized levels for all transcripts encoding the protein.</span>
