    <p>The GSEA Results data table displays the statistical results for the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,
        which can simultaneously include functional features from all categories selected for analysis. To view results for specific subsets
        of features, use the filtering menu on the left hand-side bar.
        The following table columns are displayed by default:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feature - feature name as specified in the annotation file. Note that, for GO terms, Ontology classifications
        are shown (P = Process, F = Function, C = Component).</li>
        <li>Feature ID - feature ID as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Description - feature ID description providing more details on functionality/annotation type, 
        if available, as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Significant - enrichment result given by user-defined threshold (on adjusted p-value): YES or NO. To change the significance threshold
        applied to consider a feature as significant, use the thresholding option on the left hand-side menu.</li>
        <li>Over P-Value - p-value for over representation test</li>
        <li>Under P-Value - p-value for under representation test</li>
        <li>Adjusted P-Value - over representation test FDR adjusted p-value.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Multi-dimensional enrichment analysis</span><br>
    <p>For Gene Ontology GSEA, a multi-dimensional enrichment analysis option has been implemented in tappAS. Users
    can run this analysis by selecting both the MDGSA method and the "Multidimensional mdgsa" option 
    (see Help on the Run Analysis menu for details).</p> 
    
    <p>In this case, the results table will display two Over P-value and two Adjusted P-Value 
    columns, one for each of the ranked lists under analysis. Therefore, tappAS shows no global significance status report
    for the multi-dimensional enrichment analysis. Instead, a GO term will be marked as significantly enriched (YES in the "Significant" column) 
    whenever its ranking is significant in one of the lists (considering the over p-value and filtering by the user-defined threshold).</p>
    
    <p>Note that this significance criteria is designed to be as lenient as possible, 
    providing flexibility and enabling comprehensive result visualization using the multidimensional GO term clustering implemented in tappAS.
    To run this clustering analysis, use the Enriched feature clustering button on the left hand-side menu, and select "View Multidimensional Enrichment Summary".      This option will create a "GSEA clusters" results subtab using user-defined
    criteria, and a cluster visualization can then be generated from the left hand-side bar. 
    Please, refer to subsequent Help menus for additional information.</p>
    
    <p>Of note, users may define their own significance criteria by combining the resulting (adjusted or over) p-values or 
    by filtering the results using the left hand-side menu, or, alternatively, 
    input custom GO term lists when running the Multidimensional Enrichment Summary
    (see Help after clicking the "View Multidimensional Enrichment Summary" option).</p>
    
    <p>For more information on multi-dimensional mdgsa results, see MDGSA R package documentation.</p>
