    <p>The FDA Combined Results Summary subtab contains a barplot indicating the number of features labeled as varying for the
	analyzed annotation category, comparing the genomic position and presence/absence analysis results. Only the top-15 most
	significantly varying features (i.e., IDs) are displayed. The y axis indicates the number of genes for which each
	feature is differentially annotated between isoforms, considering both analysis approaches (see FDA analysis window 
	help for details).</p>
