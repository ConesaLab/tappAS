    <div><span class="contentTitle"><b>Project Data Visualization: Functional Diversity Analysis (FDA) Summary</b></span></div>
    <p>The FDA Summary subtab contains visual display controls summarizing the analysis results.
    The display controls are described below by position, left to right.</p>
    <div style="padding-left:25px;">
        <p><b>Gene Level Functional Diversity (Presence/Position)</b> horizontal bar chart (Presence/Position indicated depending on the method used to assess diversity) - 
	    Each horizontal bar displays the percentage of multi-isoform genes annotated for the corresponding feature category.
            Each bar broken is down based on the % of feature-annotated genes that present variation for this category in at least one of their isoforms. See explanation below for details.</p>
        <p><b>Pairwise Isoforms Level Diversity</b> horizontal bar chart (Presence/Position indicated depending on the method used to assess diversity) - 
	    Displays the percentage of pairwise isoform comparisons performed for genes containing the corresponding feature annotation.
            Each bar is broken down based on the % pairwise isoforms that presented variation. See explanation below for details.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following requirements apply to this analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For a gene to be included in this analysis, it must have multiple isoforms and contain at least one instance of the selected annotation feature categories.</li>
        <li>For any given feature, only the genes with at least one isoform containing that feature are included in the specific feature category part of the analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The feature names on the y-axis are followed by an identifier for the corresponding annotation feature section, which is also indicated by bar color:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(T) - transcript section annotation feature (red).</li>
        <li>(P) - protein section annotation feature (blue).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The gene level diversity is computed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The total bar length, percentage of genes with feature category annotated, is determined by dividing the number of genes containing the feature by
            the total number of genes with multiple isoforms.</li>
        <li>The diverse and not-diverse percentages, colored sections of the bar, are determined at the gene level.
            If there are any feature differences in at least one of the isoforms for a given gene, then the whole gene is considered diverse for that feature.
            The number of diverse genes is then divided by the total number of genes containing the feature category to obtain the diverse and not-diverse percentages.
	    Total numbers of genes represented in each bar area are shown interactively when browsing through the bars.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The pairwise isoform-level diversity is computed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The total bar length is determined by dividing the total number of isoform pairs corresponding to genes annotated for each the feature by
            the total number of isoform pairs belonging to genes with multiple isoforms.</li>
        <li>The diverse and not-diverse percentages, colored sections of the bar, are determined at the pairwise isoforms level.
            For each gene, the number of pairwise isoform comparisons having diversity is determined by comparing all possible isoform pairs within the gene.
            If a pair of isoforms in the gene is different then the pair is considered diverse for that feature, instead of the whole gene.</li>
        <li>Add up the isoform pairs, having diversity for a given feature, and divide by the total number of possible isoform pairs, for all genes containing that feature, to get the percentage.
        This is the value that determines the colored divisions on the feature's bar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you probably already noticed, because of the way the percentages are computed, the gene level diverse percentages are typically higher than the pairwise isoforms level percentages.</p>

    <div><span class="contentTitle"><b>Project Data Visualization: Combined Results ID-level FDA Summary</b></span></div>
    <p>The FDA Combined Results Summary subtab contains a barplot indicating the number of features labeled as varying for the
	analyzed annotation category, comparing the genomic position and presence/absence analysis results. Only the top-15 most
	significantly varying features (i.e., IDs) are displayed. The y axis indicates the number of genes for which each
	feature is differentially annotated between isoforms, considering both analysis approaches (see FDA analysis window 
	help for details).</p>
