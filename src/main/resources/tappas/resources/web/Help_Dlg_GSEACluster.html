    <p>
    The GSEA Multidimensional Enrichment Summary table shows a shortlisted version of the Multidimensional GSEA
    Results table, using user-defined criteria to select GO terms for further analysis. 
    Features may be selected using two options, available through the parameter emerging window:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>By p-value</b> - significance columns for both ranked lists will be filtered using the user-defined
        threshold value, and the top 25 GO terms in each ranked list will be shown (i.e. total displayed: 50 GO terms).
        GO term no. limitations are designed to keep MDGSA cluster visualizations interpretable, due to the high number of
        GO terms typically returned as significant by the multidimensional MDGSA analysis method.</li>
        <li><b>By list</b> - as an alternative to the p-value based filter implemented in tappAS, users may wish to manually
        select GO terms returned by the multidimensional GSEA method for joint visualization. In this case, 
        a custom list of GO term IDs can be provided to generate the Multidimensional Enrichment Summary table.</li>
    </ul>
