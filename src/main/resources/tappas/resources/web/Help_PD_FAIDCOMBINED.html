    <p>Analyzing Functional Diversity at the ID level for the same category using both the genomic position
	and the presence/absence approaches can be used to generate a results table where both types of annotation variation
	are compared for that category. As in the ID-Level results table, rows correspond to the individual feature IDs contained
	in the annotation for the feature category selected (for instance, PFAM domains).
	The columns contain the following information:</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Feature ID: contains the ID of the feature as a composed name, integrated by the source (i.e. the database) from 
	which the annotation was retrieved, the annotation category name, and the feature name, separated by a bar. 
	Example: PFAM/DOMAIN/PF00009.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Feature Description: a more detailed description of the annotated feature, if available.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, for both genomic position and presence/absence, the following columns are available to compare varying/not varying
	status and significance in each type of analysis:</p>
    <ul>
	<li>P-Value: significance of a Fisher's Exact test performed on varying/not varying status of the feature ID
	vs the annotation variation in the entire feature category.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
	<li>AdjP-Value: adjusted p-value using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
	<li>Varying/not varying: number of genes for which the feature is detected as varying and not. The sum of these 
	two fields corresponds to the number of genes in the annotation that contain that specific feature in at least one isoform.</li>
    </ul>
