    <p>
        The Functional Enrichment Analysis Clusters Graph shows a network in which GO terms are clustered according to their functional
        similarity, i.e. the similarities in the biological processes (P), components (C) or broad molecular functions (F) that they 
        describe. The network shows all detected clusters, each of them colored by their cluster ID (i.e. cluster number/name).
        In this network:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Nodes</b> correspond to clustered GO terms. A label beside the node shows the GO term description.</li>
        <li><b>Edges</b> indicate a semantic similarity between two GO terms. Grey edges reveal within-cluster similarity, while
        yellow edges correspond to between-cluster semantic similarities between GO terms.</li>
        <li><b>Node color</b> can be used to indicate GO terms belonging to more than one cluster, and thus colored using both of 
        these cluster's colors.</li>
        <li><b>Dynamic information</b> - use the mouse to scroll the graph to view full GO term names, GO IDs, number of genes
        included in the GO term in the test list, and clustering parameters.</li>
        <li><b>Node size</b> indicates the number of genes in the test list containing the GO term.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: Users may drag nodes and cluster labels to arrange the clusters and export high quality images of the clustering results
    (see left hand-side panel "Export" button).</p>
