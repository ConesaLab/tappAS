    <div><span class="contentTitle"><b>Project Data Visualization: Differential Feature Inclusion (DFI) Summary</b></span></div>
    <p>The DFI Summary subtab contains multiple visual display controls summarizing the analysis results.
    The display controls are described below by position, left to right.</p>
    <div style="padding-left:25px;">
        <p><b>% Differentially Included Features</b> bar chart + line - Bar height represents the % of features in each category that are DFI, calculated vs the total annotated features
		for that category. Lines and dots represent the % of all the transcriptome annotated features that correspond to that feature category.</p>
        <p><b>% Differentially Included Features by Gene</b> bar chart + line -  Bar height represents the % of genes that are DFI for one or more feature 
		in each category, calculated vs the total no. of genes annotated for a features from that category (i.e.
		collapsing DFI results for genes annotated more than once for a given feature category). 
		Lines and dots represent the % of genes that are annotated for at least one feature in that feature category.</p>
        <p><b>Significance Test Result Tables </b> - shown for Differentially Included Features (left) and for Genes with Differential Feature Inclusion (right), that is
		collapsing DFI results for genes annotated more than once for a given feature category.</p>
	<p>The following columns are shown:</p>
    		<ul>
        	<li>Feature: annotation category name as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        	<li>P-Value: significance of the relative over-representation of DFI features in the specific category compared to all DFI features (Fisher's Exact Test),
			performed on the above listed groups (NDFI and DFI columns).</li>
        	<li>All_NDFI: total annotated features (all categories) not marked as DFI by the analysis.</li>
        	<li>FEAT_NDFI: total features in the specified category not marked as DFI.</li>
        	<li>ALL_DFI: total annotated features (all categories) detected as DFI in the analysis.</li>
        	<li>FEAT_DFI: total features in the specified category detected as DFI in the analysis.</li>
        	<li>Adjusted P-Value: significance level after multiple-testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction).</li>
    		</ul>
	<p>Note that, in the case of the Gene-level results table, multiple occurrences of features from the same category are counted only once (i.e. gene-level collapse of DFI results).</p>
        <p><b>Condition Favored for DFI Feature Categories</b> stacked bar chart - Proportion of features found as significantly DFI in the analysis that are favored in each of the groups.
		Results are computed from the "Favored Condition" column in the DFI Results table.</p>
        <p><b>Feature Inclusion Difference (ΔFI) Distributions for DFI Feature Categories</b> boxplot - Distribution of ΔFI values (i.e. absolute value of the the relative inclusion differences 
		between groups) in each feature category.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following requirements apply to this analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For a gene to be included in this analysis, it must have multiple isoforms and contain at least one of the selected analysis features.</li>
        <li>For any given feature, only the genes with at least one isoform containing that feature are included.</li>
    </ul>
