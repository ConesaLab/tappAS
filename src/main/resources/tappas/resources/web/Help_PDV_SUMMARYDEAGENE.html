    <div><span class="contentTitle">Project Data Visualization: Genes DEA Summary</span></div>
    <p>The Genes DEA Summary subtab contains multiple visual display controls, along with supporting tables, summarizing the genes DEA results.
    The display controls are described below by position, left to right.</p>
    <div style="padding-left:25px;">
        <p><b>Genes DEA Results</b> pie chart and data tables - the pie chart displays the proportions for differentially and not differentially expressed genes.
            The top table displays the following table columns for single transcript, multiple transcripts, and total genes.
            The bottom table displays the same columns for non-coding, single and multiple proteins coding, and total genes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gene - gene type</li>
            <li>DE - number of differentially expressed genes of given type</li>
            <li>Not DE - number of NOT differentially expressed genes of given type</li>
            <li>Total - total number of genes of given type</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Genes Log2 Fold Change Distribution</b> bar chart - displays the L2FC distribution for all genes.
            The bins for the fold changes are shown on the x-axis with the down-regulated genes on the left part and the up-regulated genes on the right. 
            Square brackets, [], are used to denote values that are inclusive and parentheses, (), for values that are exclusive. 
            For example, a bin with a "[5, 10)" label contains values from 5 to less than 10, i.e. inclusive of 5 but exclusive of 10.
            Note that up and down regulation is based on the condition comparison you selected for the analysis.
            The total number of genes for a given bin is determined by the height of the bars along the y-axis.
            Negative values are used for down regulated counts, on the y-axis, for visualization purposes only; counts are always positive.
        </p>
