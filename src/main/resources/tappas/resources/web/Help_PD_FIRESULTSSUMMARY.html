    <p>The DFI Results Summary displays the statistical analysis results from the DFI analysis 
	for each feature ID, i.e. creates a table of DFI results where DFI-feature containing genes are grouped by functional feature ID,
	showing a count of DFI frequencies for each of them. 
	To explore uncollapsed results, right-click any of the functional feature IDs to "Drill down" the data. The drill down option 
	provides the list of gene IDs that contain that feature as DFI.
        The following table columns are displayed by default (more columns can be added via the right hand-side (+) button):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feature - feature category name as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Feature ID - feature ID as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>Feature Description - functional feature description as specified in the annotation file.</li>
        <li>DFI Feature IDs - number of genes for which a given feature ID is detected as DFI.</li>
        <li>Condition1 Favored - number of genes in which feature inclusion is favored in condition 1, based on expression levels of feature-containing isoforms.</li>
        <li>Condition2 Favored - number of genes in which feature inclusion is favored in condition 2, based on expression levels of feature-containing isoforms.</li>
        <li>Tested Feature IDs - total number of genes for which the feature ID was tested for differential inclusion.</li><br>
    </ul>
Note that "condition" only refers to two-group comparisons. For time course designs (single and multiple series), a list of favored time points will be provided.
